# Team Synergy Project 2 - PokéPost Website
The front end of Team Synergy's Pokemon database, PokéPost. This will interact with the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to pull Pokémon data and construct a page containing data about a particular Pokémon along with fan comments and fanart.

## Description
Users will be able to do the following on our website:

* View any Pokémon or get all Pokémon in a particular region.
* Add comments on a Pokémon page for tips or comments and like them.
* Add fanart to a Pokémon page and comment/like them.
* Add Pokémon to a wishlist to keep track of the ones they're trying to find.
* Register and log into an account.

Administrators can moderate comments and fanart and even ban users from posting.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* [PokéPost Web Application](https://github.com/220620-java/p2-back-pokemondb)
* File Hosting Server to host website

### Installing
Upload files to a web server or static website host and change the URLs to point towards your web application server.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
